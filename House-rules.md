# Grammars-v5 House Rules

## Ground Rules

* All contributions are welcome ranging from spelling mistakes to new grammars. Grammars-v4 aims to be a welcoming community in which both novice and expert contributors are welcome.  "How do I?" questions are welcomed, and encouraged.
* The repository owners hold final approval on all commits, and changes to the repository
* No hate speech, racism, sexism, or ethnocentrism is tolerated. Trolling and personal attacks are not welcome.

## Contributing

New grammars and bug fixes are welcome.  All changes must pass CI in order to be pulled.  Examples for new grammars are strongly encouraged.  If new features or bug fixes are added to grammars, examples that exercise the feature or fix are also strongly encouraged.

## Traditions 

* In general, contributors are thanked for every commit
* Symbol conflicts are generally resolved by appending an underscore to identifiers. For example "id" becomes "id_"
* The formatting style produced by [Antlr5Formatter](https://github.com/antlr/Antlr5Formatter) is the typical code formatting for grammars

## History of Grammars-V5

The grammars-v4 repository was created `Tue Sep 25 16:45:12 2012 -0700`.  The repository was created as a place to hold grammars for [Antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/).  
Early 2024, with the initiation of [antlr5](https://github.com/antlr/antlr5), we needed a place to store equivalent grammars for antlr5.

There is no single license for the Antlr5 grammars. Many of the grammars have licensing information in the .g5 file(s).

It is a tradition to thank every contributor to grammars-v5 for the time and effort they put into their pull requests.  There is a "thank-you" for every PR when it is pulled onto the tree.  Additionally grammars-v5 aims to be a welcoming community for all contributors both experienced and novice to contribute to, and to learn from.
